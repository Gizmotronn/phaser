Hi there! My name is Liam, also known as OpusTheRobot. I'm an Australian game and website developer. This website is home to all my projects that I'm working on as well as my personal blog. I'll also be talking about my youtube stuff here.

# Youtube
In January 2016, I created my youtube channel. The first video I posted on it, The Steampunk Droids, currently has ~350 views on youtube and was basically a "highlights video" of building my first robot/droid, Sp-D2. I changed the name to Droidology in 2017, and that was the name it stayed as until March this year.

The reason for this was because I had already gotten into trouble when trying to trademark ACORD under its previous name "droid", as droid was trademarked by Disney. I asked one of my mates what I should switch the channel name to, and he came up with an answer right away -

> You should call yourself "Limology"

And that was that. At least for 2 months, Limology was my title on Youtube. Until yesterday, when I determined that Limology wasn't:

- Professional enough (as eventually it would be rebranded as part of the ACORD umbrella)
- Cool enough (people like Iskall85, Rendog, etc had much better names, and I couldn't see myself getting into Hermitcraft with the name Limology)

The second reason was the most pressing at the time, but those were the 2 reasons why I decided to change the name.

# And the winner is...

> Hold on...I've got the best name!

You may know I'm working on a science fiction story called [Star Sailors](http://github.com/acord-robotics/starsailors). The main character in the book is called Opus. Opus is also the name of a robot in a beautiful mobile rpg. I decided Opus would be my name.

But Opus on its own wouldn't be enough. I'm not really a numbers person (unless we're talking sports), so I racked my brains to think about what I do on my channel. I showcase robots occasionally, and I often refer to myself as a "droid" (fair enough, considering my previous name). 

> What about "OpusTheRobot?"

And that was that.

# What's the plan for youtube

I'm going to be doing another post for this soon, but I will say this:

- We're going to have redstone showcases for Minecraft JAVA edition
- We're going to try and release 3 Mushlantis (Minecraft Bedrock Surival LP) episodes each month
- Just Cause 3, Starbound and other games will have episodes on average once a month
- In the holidays, we'll try and have 1 video each day. We have ~16 days, so that's 8 videos -
  - 4 Mushlantis episodes
  - 2 redstone showcases
  - 2 other videos
- In the summer holidays, we'll have 1 video every 2 days. 
- This means we could get 30-40 episodes of Mushlantis by the end of the year!
